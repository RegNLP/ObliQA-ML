This Chapter details the Rules stipulating the need to complete internal risk assessments by Authorised Persons in defined frequencies and the Regulator's role in reviewing the results of such assessments. In the case of Authorised Persons facing financial risks, the requirements in this Chapter mandate completion of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. The Regulator will review the results of such internal risk assessments. This Chapter also sets out how the Regulator may impose an additional Capital Requirement on a firm specific basis in addition to the minimum requirement specified in Chapter 3 of these Rules to address higher-than-normal risk.",

For example, a Relevant Person may undertake some aspects of CDD, such as identifying Beneficial Owners, when it performs a risk assessment of the customer. Conversely, a Relevant Person may also obtain relevant information as part of CDD which has an impact on its customer risk assessment.

As illustrated in paragraph 2.2, an authorised money remittance house does not need to apply for specific approvals from the FSRA to use Virtual Assets if it merely uses Virtual Assets as a medium of exchange to facilitate the remittance of fiat currencies on behalf of Clients across jurisdictions.  The Regulated Firm will, however, have to demonstrate that the use of the Virtual Asset, used in such ancillary manner, is fit for purpose, e.g., putting in place control requirements to address technology and security risks associated with the use of the Virtual Asset.  On the other hand, for example, if the Regulated Firm offers its Clients services to exchange Virtual Assets for fiat currencies, the Regulated Firm will need to apply to, and be authorised by, the FSRA to use Virtual Assets as part of its Regulated Activities.\n",

Further guidance on the considerations applicable to entities wishing to operate as a DSF are set out in paragraphs 55 – 61 above.  Note, however, that with respect to Authorised Persons currently Operating an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets), the FSRA will require the DSF to be a separate legal/operating entity from those entities it is providing settlement services (MIR Rule 3.8) and/or custody services (MIR Rule 2.10) for.  Migration of an independent Virtual Asset Custodian to being a DSF may therefore likely pose less operational/regulatory issues than an entity currently operating as both an MTF (in relation to Virtual Assets) and Virtual Asset Custodian.\n",

This is due to a number of factors, including that a RIE is required to meet the full suite of requirements in Chapters 2 and 3 of MIR, and the primary market considerations associated with operating a RIE (e.g., requirement for Approved Prospectuses, admission to the Official List of Securities, and the ongoing technical/operational and regulatory requirements related to Digital Securities being admitted to trading and admitted to the Official List).\n",

For example, an MTF using Virtual Assets is required by COBS Rule 17.7.4  to notify the FSRA of any new Accepted Virtual Asset proposed to be admitted to trading on its facilities.  Though the MTF may propose to admit to trading a commonly used and traded Virtual Asset, the MTF’s controls, for example, relating to identity/transaction monitoring of a certain distributed ledger may not yet be fully developed. In such circumstances, the FSRA may require the MTF to delay the commencement of trading until such time that suitable controls have been developed and implemented.\n",
