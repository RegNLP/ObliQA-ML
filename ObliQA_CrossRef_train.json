The mining reporting entity\u2019s production target is based on its current expectation of future results or events, and should not be solely relied upon by investors when making investment decisions.\u201d\nGuidance\nAny statement about a Production Target will be deemed to be misleading unless the person making the statement has reasonable grounds for making the statement.  The Regulator considers that it is only under exceptional circumstances that a Mining Reporting Entity might form a view that it has reasonable grounds for a Production Target to be wholly based on Inferred Mineral Resources.\n(6)\tif the Production Target is in part based on Inferred Mineral Resources, an at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that:\n\u201cThe level of geological confidence associated with inferred mineral resources is low. There is no certainty that further evaluation and/or exploration work will result in the determination of indicated mineral resources or that the production target itself will be realised.\u201d\n(7)\tif the Production Target is in part based on an Exploration Target:\n(a)\ta statement of the factors that lead the Mining Reporting Entity to believe that it has a reasonable basis for disclosing a Production Target based, in part, on an Exploration Target; and\n(b)\tan at least equally prominent, and proximate, statement to the effect that:\n\u201cThe potential quantity and grade of an Exploration Target is only conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to determine a Mineral Resource and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in the determination of Mineral Resources or that the Production Target itself will be realised.\u201d"

The following are specific examples of an abusive squeeze that, in the Regulator's view, may contravene section 92 (4)(b):\n(a)\tduring the course of a trading day on a Commodity Derivative Exchange, a trader rapidly builds up a position of more than 90% of the physical inventory underlying a crude oil contract.  The trader fails to Offer to lend the crude oil back to other market participants at a reasonable commercial rate.  The trader then unwinds his position in the Exchange's final settlement window  at rapidly increasing prices, thereby cornering/squeezing the crude oil market.  His conduct causes an abnormal movement in the price of crude oil contracts for forward month delivery; and\n(b)\ta trader with a long position in bond futures, buys or borrows a large amount of the bonds and either refuses to re-lend these bonds or will only lend them to parties he believes will not re-lend to the market.  His purpose is to position the price at which persons with short positions have to deliver to satisfy their obligations at a materially higher level, making him a profit on his position."
