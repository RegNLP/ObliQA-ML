No two Relevant Persons will have the same approach and implementation of the RBA and the AML Rulebook permits a Relevant Person to design and implement systems and controls that are appropriate to its business and customers, with the obvious caveat that such systems should be reasonable and proportionate in light of the money laundering risks.
